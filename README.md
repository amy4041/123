Today is Saturdat.
I want to get up earily but I failed.

I decided to do the lanudry and go to eat breakfast while the clothes are being washed.
 
I found that I forgot to bring my key with me. I was locked out of my door.

I called my landlord and wait for him to open the door for me.

While waiting for the landlord, I go for a walk.
